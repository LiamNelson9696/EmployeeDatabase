In a programming languages course, I had the opportunity to learn and code in a new language every other week. Throughout the course, we covered the fundamentals of various languages including Rust, Fortran, and HTML+Javascript. This experience greatly improved my confidence and flexibility as a programmer. I am particularly interested in sharing my Cobol assignment because it was an entirely unique language that I had never encountered before.
